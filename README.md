Package gowp (Go Worker-Pool) provides concurrency limiting, error propagation, and Context cancellation for a group of workers/goroutines.

## Features

- Context cancellation, won't process new tasks if parent context gets cancelled.
- Error propagation, will return the first error encountered.
- Exit on error, if specified, it won't process further tasks if an error is encountered.
- Concurrency limiting

## Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/akshaybharambe14/gowp
```

## Why?

Goroutines are cheap in terms of memory, but not free. If you want to achieve extreme performance, you need to limit the number of goroutines you use. Also, in real world applications, you need to take care of the failures. This package does that for you.

This package works best with short bursts of tasks. We have other packages that are meant for running huge number of tasks.

### Why yet another worker pool implementation

I wanted to build a perfect worker pool implementation with above specified features. We have other implementations, but I think they do a lot of work in background if used to execute fixed set of tasks. Gowp outperforms some of them ([see benchmarks](#Benchmarks)).

## Benchmarks

For following benchmarks, a single operation means running 10 tasks over 4 workers.
